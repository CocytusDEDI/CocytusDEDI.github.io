People across the world can come together to contribute to software that benefits and progresses humankind with the power and efficiency that computers give us. I’ve started a few projects over time, many as experiments to test out the field I was working in and many have been left unfinished, but I’ve detailed some of the more impressive ones in the projects section for all to see. The projects listed are not up to date and contain some of my older (and not very good) code, I hope you keep in mind while looking at my code that my skill has improved since then (or so I hope). If you'd like to see what I'm up too now, look at my GitHub page at </span> <a href="https://github.com/CocytusDEDI" target="_blank"><span class="link">https://github.com/CocytusDEDI</span></a>
