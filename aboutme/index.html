I admire the well-designed and nuanced systems overlord implements, which resonates with my love for such intricacies. The property of careful design that overlord achieves, I aspire to emulate in my own creations. Though, instead of through story telling, I want to do so with computers.<br><br>Computers to me are a method of achieving convenience and utility for everyone, a method that captivates my interest because of the constant improvements that can be added. People across the world can come together to contribute to software that benefits and progresses humankind with such power and efficiency that only computers can give us. That along with my like of defence, simply as a concept, has resulted in me focusing my research and efforts on cybersecurity.<br><br>While not all related to cybersecurity, I’ve started quite a few projects over time, many as experiments to test out the field I was working in and many have been left unfinished, but I’ve detailed some of the more impressive ones in the projects section for all to see. I hope you keep in mind while looking at my code skills that they have improved since then (or so I hope).</span>
