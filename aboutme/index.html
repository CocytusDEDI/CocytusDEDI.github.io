		    <span class="blogText">My favourite show, Overlord, is so highly rated by me because of it’s magic system and world building. A well designed and nuanced system is something I’m very keen about, which is why I liked overlord so much and is why I like computers so much. A computer can carry out immensely complicated operations, around the world and at high speeds, combined together they form a wealth of knowledge, convenience and utility, that’s why I find them so interesting. That along with my like of defence, simply as a concept, has resulted in me focusing my research and efforts on cybersecurity.<br><br>While not all related to cybersecurity, I’ve started quite a few projects over time, many as experiments to test out the field I was working in and many have been left unfinished, but I’ve detailed some of the more impressive ones in the projects section for all to see. I hope you look on my old coding skills with the knowledge that my skills have improved since then (or so I hope) in mind.</span>
